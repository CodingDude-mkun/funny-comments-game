# Project Log: Funny Comments Game

This document chronicles the key actions and progress made during the development of the Funny Comments Game.

## Initial Setup & Repository Creation

- **Project Initialization:** Started with a React frontend and an empty backend directory within `product-game/`.
- **Git Repository:** Initialized a new Git repository in `product-game/` (named `funny-comments-game`).
- **.gitignore:** Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, `build`, `.env`, Python cache, and virtual environments.
- **Initial Commit:** Committed the basic project structure to the `main` branch of the new repository.
- **Remote Repository:** Configured and pushed the local repository to `https://github.com/CodingDude-mkun/funny-comments-game.git`.

## Backend Development (FastAPI & PostgreSQL)

- **Dependencies:** Created `backend/requirements.txt` with `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-socketio[asgi]`, `sqlalchemy`, and `psycopg2-binary`.
- **Main Application File:** Created `backend/main.py` with a basic FastAPI app, CORS middleware, and Socket.IO setup.
- **Database Configuration:** Created `backend/database.py` for SQLAlchemy engine and session management, with a placeholder for `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`.
- **Database Models:** Defined `backend/models.py` with SQLAlchemy ORM models for `User`, `Lobby`, `LobbyMember`, `Round`, `Product`, `Comment`, and `Vote`.
- **CRUD Operations:** Created `backend/crud.py` to encapsulate database interactions for users and lobbies (get, create).
- **User Management Endpoints:** Added API endpoints in `main.py` for:
    - User registration (`POST /users/`)
    - User login (`POST /login/`)
- **Lobby Management Endpoints:** Added API endpoints in `main.py` for:
    - Lobby creation (`POST /lobbies/`)
    - Listing lobbies (`GET /lobbies/`)
    - Joining a lobby (`POST /lobbies/{lobby_id}/join/{user_id}`)
- **Deployment Configuration Files:**
    - Created `backend/Procfile` for Render deployment (`web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`).
    - Created `backend/start.sh` for local development (install dependencies, create tables, run uvicorn).

## Environment & Troubleshooting

- **Python Environment:** Assisted with `pip` and `py` launcher usage for dependency installation.
- **Database Connection:** Identified and resolved issue with connecting to Render's internal PostgreSQL URL from local environment by switching to the external URL for local testing.

## Documentation

- **README.md:** Created a comprehensive `README.md` in the project root outlining the project overview, technology stack, features, and deployment strategy.
- **PLAN.md:** Created a detailed `PLAN.md` to track development progress.
